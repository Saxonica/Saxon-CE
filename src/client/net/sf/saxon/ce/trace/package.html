</head>

<body>

<p>This package provides an interface to Saxon tracing and debugging capabilities.</p>

<p>The package includes a tracing modules that can be optionally selected:
<code>XSLTTraceListener</code> and <code>TimedTraceListener</code>. These receive notification of the same events,
but select and format the events in different ways to meet different requirements.
Other events are notified through the <code>TraceListener</code> interface that
are ignored by tracing applications, but may be of interest to debuggers.</p>
