<title>Package overview for net.sf.saxon.number</title>
</head>

<body>

<p>This package provides classes associated with numbering and the <code>xsl:number</code> element. </p>

<p>It is possible to extend the range of numberings available by providing a Numberer
for a specific language. This must be registered with the <code>Configuration</code>.
In earlier releases, there was a fixed relationship between the language and the
    implementing class (the Numberer was always named Numberer_xx where xx is the language code,
corresponding to the value of the lang attribute in <code>xsl:number</code>). From Saxon 9.2,
this relationship no longer exists.</p>

<p>These classes also include code to support the localization of dates as defined
in the XSLT <code>format-dateTime()</code> group of functions.</p>

<p>The class <code>Numberer_en</code> provides the standard numbering options. As well as the
format tokens defined in the XSLT 1.0 specification (for example, "1", "001", "a", "i") it supports
other numbering options including:</p>

<li>
<ul>Greek upper and lower case letters</ul>
<ul>Cyrillic upper and lower case letters</ul>
<ul>Hebrew letters</ul>
<ul>Japanese: Hiragana-A, Hiragana-B, Katakana-A, or Katakana-B letters, and Kanji digits</ul>
<ul>English words: the format token "one" produces numbers such as "twenty five"</ul>
</li>

<p>Localizations for a number of European languages are provided in package <code>net.sf.saxon.option.local</code>.
In Saxon-PE and Saxon-EE these are issued in binary form as part of the Saxon JAR. For Saxon-HE, they are
issued only in source code form.</p>
