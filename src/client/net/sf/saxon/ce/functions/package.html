<title>Package overview for net.sf.saxon.functions</title>
</head>

<body>

<p>This package provides implementations of all the core functions available for use
in XPath expressions. This includes all the functions defined in the XPath 2.0
<i>Functions and Operators</i> specification, as well as the additional functions
defined for use in XSLT. The package also includes Saxon extension functions. Most
of these are in a single class <code>Extensions</code>, but some of the more
complex functions are in their own classes, for example <code>Evaluate</code> implements
<code>saxon:evaluate()</code>.</p>

<p>There is one class for group of closely-related functions. These all inherit from the class
net.sf.saxon.expr.Function. The class <code>StandardFunction</code> is used to map a function
name to its implementation; it contains tables of information describing the signature of each
function, so that the type-checking code is completely generic.</p>

<p>The package also contains machinery for defining user extension functions. A collection
of functions is represented by a <code>FunctionLibrary</code> object. There are several
standard function libraries available, covering core functions, Saxon extension functions
constructor functions, and user extension functions: each category is covered by a subclass
of <code>FunctionLibrary</code>, and there is also a <code>FunctionLibraryList</code> that
represents the total collection of functions in these individual libraries. The
<code>JavaExtensionLibrary</code> contains the logic for binding Java extension functions
given their name and arity and the types of their arguments. The class <code>ExtensionFunctionCall</code>
contains the run-time logic for converting XPath values to the required Java types, and for converting
the result back to an XPath value.</p>

<p>These classes, although public, will not normally be used directly by user-written
 Java applications.</p>
