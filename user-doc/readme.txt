The user-doc directory is the container for all the resource files used for rendering the Saxon-CE 1.1 documentation
using Saxon-CE. 

This directory is designed to be maintained under source-control, but also to be used as a localhost web-server
virtual directory so changes made can be reviewed in the browser in real-time without the need to copy files.

Directories
-----------

1. doc
------
Container for all the documentation XML files such as about.xml, also contains catalog.xml that references every other
xml file in the directory. The catalog.xml file is used by the XSLT to update /index.html.

2. html
-------
Container for static html files generated by transforming files in the 'doc' directory.

3. image
--------
Container for the images used by the viewer application - such as icon images, logos etc.

4. xsl
------
Holds the XSLT files used by Saxon-CE to render the web pages (stored in the 'doc' directory) dynamically.
This also contains a 'static' directory.

5. xsl/static
-------------
Holds the XSLT files used to build a static version of the website for SEO purposes, or for use in browsers with
JavaScript disabled. The XSLT files here mostly correspond to those in the main 'xsl' directory. There is also
a 'build' directory.

6. xsl/static/build
--------------------
Contains the ant build resources used to generate static chuncked html and directory structure from the XML files stored
in the 'doc' directory

7. docimg
---------
Intended for use when actual content references image resources (with img tags).

Top-level Files
---------------

1. index.html
-------------
The entry-point for the website - this is modified by Saxon-CE using catalog.XML as the starting point

2. cetree.js
-------------
Contains javascript functions used by the Saxon-CE  XSLT transforms

3. cetree.css
-------------
Style definitions controlling both page layout and content rendering (this should eventually be refactored to split the
different areas of concern).

Other Dependencies
------------------
1. The Saxon-CE build directory (either 'Saxonce' or SaxonceDebug') should be a sibling directory to this directory in the
web-server.
