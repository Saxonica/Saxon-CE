Saxon-CE
========

XSLT 2.0 in the browser.

Historical Note
===============

Saxon-CE was Saxonica's first venture into client-side (browser-based) XSLT support,
including interactive XSLT extensions designed to allow an XSLT stylesheet to respond
to user interaction events by modifying the content of the HTML page.

The product was a stripped-down version of the Saxon-Java code, cross-compiled to
Javascript using Google's GWT transpiler.

It has since been superseded by Saxon-JS, which is written in pure Javascript, but
which retains the interactive XSLT extensions.

Saxon-CE is no longer maintained or supported and should not be used for new projects.
